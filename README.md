# Sorting Algorithms Project

This project implements various sorting algorithms in C language, focusing on understanding algorithm efficiency and implementation.

## Project Overview

- **Curriculum:** SE Foundations
- **Average Score:** 85.49%
- **Captain's Log:** Due before 2024-02-25 (in about 14 hours)

## Project Details

- **By:** Alexandre Gautier
- **Team:** PARFAIT Rugwiro Dominique Parfait
- **Project Start:** February 14, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** February 25, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding of various sorting algorithms.
- Mastery of Big O notation and time complexity evaluation.
- Selection of appropriate sorting algorithms based on input data.
- Understanding stable sorting algorithms.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Compiler:** gcc (with options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89)
- **File Endings:** All files should end with a newline
- **README:** A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- **Code Style:** Follow the Betty style guide
- **Global Variables:** Not allowed
- **Functions per File:** Maximum 5
- **Standard Library:** Unless specified, do not use standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- **Header Files:** Prototypes should be included in a header file named sort.h
- **Header Guards:** All header files should be include guarded

### GitHub

- **Repository:** One repository per group; cloning/forking existing projects with the same name before the second deadline results in a 0% score

## Data Structure and Functions

- Provided functions: print_array, print_list
- Use the provided doubly linked list structure for list-related operations

## Tasks

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Sort an array of integers in ascending order using Bubble sort algorithm.
   - Print the array after each swap.
   - Provide Big O notations for best case, average case, and worst case in the file 0-O.

2. **Insertion Sort**
   - Sort a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using Insertion sort algorithm.
   - Print the list after each swap.
   - Provide Big O notations for best case, average case, and worst case in the file 1-O.

3. **Selection Sort**
   - Sort an array of integers in ascending order using Selection sort algorithm.
   - Print the array after each swap.
   - Provide Big O notations for best case, average case, and worst case in the file 2-O.

4. **Quick Sort**
   - Sort an array of integers in ascending order using Quick sort algorithm with Lomuto partition scheme.
   - Print the array after each swap.
   - Provide Big O notations for best case, average case, and worst case in the file 3-O.

## Additional Notes

- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden.
- Ensure adherence to project guidelines and standards.
- Test algorithms with big sets of random integers.
